# GoDaddy GitHub Repositories Explorer

A modern, responsive React application that displays GoDaddy's GitHub repositories with advanced filtering, search, and detailed repository information.


## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Styled Components** for styling and theming
- **React Router** for navigation
- **Lucide React** for icons
- **Vite** for bundling
- **Jest** and **React Testing Library** for testing

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/amaannawab923/godaddy-repos.git
cd godaddy-repos
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```


4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## 🧪 Running Tests

Run the test suite:
```bash
npm run test
```

## Aspects that were left out due to time constraints 
1. I typically set up a comprehensive Cypress test suite for automated test execution within the GitHub pipeline. However, for this case, I deemed it unnecessary, as it would have been overly complex for the scope of the task.

2 .When displaying lists, I generally implement pagination or an infinite loader to enhance performance and usability. Due to limited time, I did not include this, but it is something I would have prioritized under normal circumstances.
